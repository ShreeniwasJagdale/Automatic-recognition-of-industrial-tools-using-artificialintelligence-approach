Introduction: 
The problem was to segregate mixed up tools in a manufacturing unit. There is a possibility that different types of spanners, screwdrivers can get mixed up and it would be time-consuming to sort these and arrange. Not only will it consume time but reduces the productivity of the workers which could have been applied to other places. This can also mean that we can sort between various sizes of nuts, bolts, and washers. 

Applications:
Segregation when completely automated, saves time and increases profits. The above code has been applied to segregate various tools namely spanner, hammer, and screwdriver. This can be extended to segregate various objects, tools, and their varieties. A few applications of the same are mentioned as follows Nuts and bolts of different sizes can be separated with the help of an embedded mechanical system. This will help out big manufacturing plants save time. Sometimes flaws in products are too small to be noticed by the naked eye. Very sensitive cameras can be used to detect the smallest defects. This can reduce human effort, time, and money. An example of the above is in the automotive industry where engine cylinders are manufactured. The cylinders can be checked using this technology as it involves a high degree of precision.
